The repository to create a vagrant development environment for our project.

## Installation

### I will put better instructions up later.

1. Install Vagrant
    1. Go to [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/)
    2. Follow instructions for your os.
2. Use GIT to copy this directory to somewhere on your computer
3. Navigate to the folder in terminal/command line
4. Run Vagrant Up

    This will take a long time (5-10 min), as it has to download the ubuntu image file and configure it.

3. See vagrant file for ip to connect to.
